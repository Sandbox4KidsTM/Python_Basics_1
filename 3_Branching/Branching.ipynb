    "# Branching and Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Branching is an essential part of most programs. Our program flow thus far have been linear, running one command after another until we have no lines of Python left to run. Let's say we wanted offer our users a choice between buying a hamburger or a cheeseburger. No matter what our user responds we are going to end up running both the hamburger code *and* the cheeseburger code. Our user is going to be very confused when they are forced to pay for and eat both a hamburger and a cheeseburger. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Ask the user what they want.\n",
    "burger = input(\"Would you like a cheeseburger or a hamburger?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# We are okay so far, we can use their response to answer.\n",
    "# But it isn't a great solution, what if they had typed in sushi??\n",
    "print(\"One {} coming up!\".format(choice))\n",
    "\n",
    "# But now we have to charge them for something\n",
    "# and cook them something.\n",
    "order_hamburger()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait but did they order that?\n",
    "# Better just order a hamburger, just to be safe.\n",
    "order_cheeseburger()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Thanks for your order!\")\n",
    "# Now Im in a bunch of trouble!!\n",
    "# I cost the customer money and wasted food!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a couple of things to note about the code above:\n",
    "1. The lines that start with `#` are **Comments**, Python ignores anything that has a `#` before it. It gives us programmers a way to communicate our ideas and how our program work!\n",
    "2. The `order_hamburger()` and `order_cheeseburger()` are functions, just like the built-in functions like the ones we have seen before except they are *not* (as nice as that would be) built-in. So if they are not built-in, where are they coming from? They would have been defined somewhere else in the program, maybe by YOU. Right now they are just being use to express an idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so obvously my code is not ready for real use yet but lets see if we can get it there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operators and Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen several operators so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Name |\n",
    "|----------|------|\n",
    "| + | Addition |\n",
    "| - | Subtraction |\n",
    "| *  | Multiplication |\n",
    "| /  | Division |\n",
    "| =  | Assignment |\n",
    "\n",
    "But we have a few more to learn!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Operators\n",
    "| Operator | Description | Example |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| == | Equals (True if both sides are equal) | x == 5 |\n",
    "| != | Not Equal (True if both sides are **NOT** equal | x != y |\n",
    "| < | Less Than | x < 10 |\n",
    "| > | Greater Than | z > 0 |\n",
    "| <= | Less Than Or Equal To | a <= b |\n",
    "| >= | Greater Than Or Equal To | c >= d |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Operators\n",
    "| Operator | Description | Example | True if: |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| and | True if both sides are True | x > 0 and x < 10 | x is between 0 and 10 |\n",
    "| or | True if one of the sides is True | x == y or z == w | x and y are equal OR z and w are equal |\n",
    "| not | Reverse a bool, True if bool was False | not(x == x or 5 == 10) | Never |\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more operators but they are less used. We may talk about a few later, but on we go!\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Comparison and Logical Operators we can evaluate complex comparisons to either `True` or `False`!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge:\n",
    "Evaluate the following if `x = 5; y = 10; z = -15`:\n",
    "1. x == 5\n",
    "2. y == 8 or z == -15\n",
    "3. x == 5 and y < 55 and z >= z\n",
    "4. x == 1 or not(y == 10 and x < 0)\n",
    "5. not(not(x > 10) and not(y > x and y > z))\n",
    "\n",
    "## Branching - IF\n",
    "Okay, with comparisons under our belts we can start branching! In Computer Science, branching is making a choice to run certain code depending on what *conditions* have been met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary tool for branching in Python is the `if` statement. The `if` statement runs a block of code only if a certain condition is `True`. For example:"

    "`if` statements run (or don't run) **blocks** of code. A block of code in Python is written differently than in most languages. A **block** starts after the colon `:` at the end of the if statement and any lines of code that we want to put in the block **must** be intented by **4 spaces** past the beginning of the block above it.

We will see other programming patterns later that can help avoid these huge structures."
